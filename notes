To speed up GET requests from S3 use Elasticache Redis (not Dynamo DAX, which only works with Dynamo)
NAT Gateways are placed within public subnets (not attached to VPCs) - they allow instances in private subnets to access the internet
VPC Flow logs used for grabbing the IP addresses and other info from requests going through an ELB, specify the network interfaces (not the subnet, which would be less secure)
There's one Network Interface for each ELB subnet
VPG - AWS side of the VPN
Customer Gateway - Customer Side of the VPN
default NACL Rules - allow all inbound/outbound
custom NACL Rules (default) - deny all inbound/outbound
Transit Gateway works withIN a region, not globally

TemplateURL control which templates IAM users can use when they create or update stacks
Elaticache Redis - persistent data store, optimized retrieval times
Relational DBs are not used for session state data bc of strict format
Stick Sessions on a ELB - return info on user session (also for keeping a session on a specific Ec2 instance/server)
Ec2 in private subnet > internet = NAT gateway in public subnet + route pointing to IGW
Aurora Global Database - read access in multiple regions (not write in active/active formation)

ALB - HTTP/HTTPS only
NLB - TCP/SSL
Capture details about HTTTP traffic processed by ALB : enable access logs and store logs on S3
Multi-site: disaster recovery option, active-active minimal downtime and dataloss
EBS - there is no direct way to change the encryption state of a volume
When restoring to a saved DB state, default DB security group will be user automatically and will always be a new DB instance w/new DNS endpoint
Restores up to last 5 minutes
In default VPC: instances assigned a private and public DNS hostname
In custom VPC: instances assigned only private DNS hostname
Field Level Encryption - provides encryption in transit for CloudFront, encrypted at Edge
AWS SAM - serverless application model -extention of cloudFormation used to test, package + deploy serverless apps
Per-method throttling limits- applies to all users using same method
Per-client throttling limits - applies to client(s) that use your keys + usage policy
FIFO guarantees duplicates are not introduced into the queue
SNS - transport protocols - HTTPS and Email-JSON
ALB can authenticate users from OIDC (OpenID Connect) compliant ID providers (google, facebook)
  - authentication action on a listener rule that configures Cognito user pool w/ social IdP

Subnet ID, Security Group ID: VPC specific info needed for Lambda to access Elaticache cluster in same AWS accts VPC
Elasticache w Redis: can enable encryption in transit
Redis AUTH command is used when passing credentials to the database
Best Practices Used for DynamoDB::::: Compress larger attribute values, store objects larger than 400kb in S3 and use pointers, store frequently and infrequently accessed data
in separate tables, keep item size small, if serial data based on time/date, used separate tables for days, weeks, months...
Alias records used to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to: ELB, API custom regional APIs + edge optimized APIs, CloudFront Distros, Elatic Beakstalk Environments
S3 Buckets, website endpoints, VPC interface endpoints, and other records
Single Sign on for mobile apps: Cognito
Single Sign on btwn prem + mgmt console - STS + SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
AWS Batch - multi-node parallel job, managed service, HPC
CloudFormation Cluster Group - customer managed
Subnets are always associated with a route table when created, auto-assigned to main route table which has no internet access
Install MySQL on new Ec2 + enable replication in another AZ
General Purpose SSD gives 3 IOPS/GB up to 16,000 IOPS, Vol Size 1GB - 16TB
Bucket Policy Best Practice: use DNS/URLS instead of IP addresses (which can often change)
IAM Query API - make direct calls to IAM service
Lambda Used parameter store to keep credentials out of the code
IPSec VPN + same BGP - add resiliency to Direct Connect
Connection Draining Timer - ELB allows connections to finish before termination instance
EMR is good for analyzing log files

API calls require access keys
Auto complete is a good use case for redis elasticache
Create a VPC security group for the ELB and use Lambda to update CloudFront internal service IP when they change
Use a gateway endpoint with public services like S3 and DynamoDB
Use interface endpoint for private services
NLV + PrivateLink -  grant access to private VPC w/application inside
