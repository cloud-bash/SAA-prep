To speed up GET requests from S3 use Elasticache Redis (not Dynamo DAX, which only works with Dynamo)
NAT Gateways are placed within public subnets (not attached to VPCs) - they allow instances in private subnets to access the internet
VPC Flow logs used for grabbing the IP addresses and other info from requests going through an ELB, specify the network interfaces (not the subnet, which would be less secure)
There's one Network Interface for each ELB subnet
VPG - AWS side of the VPN
Customer Gateway - Customer Side of the VPN
default NACL Rules - allow all inbound/outbound
custom NACL Rules (default) - deny all inbound/outbound
Transit Gateway works withIN a region, not globally
VPG works btwn regions to connect VPCs + direct ocnnect networks
User Pools - sign in through 3rd party IdP
Identity Pools - grant temporary access to AWS services (S3, Dynamo)
Alias cannot point to a WAF, use OAI + enable WAF on Cloudfront w/S3
